# PROG 01: Crunch Time

CalFit is a calories workout conversion app that computes basic conversions between 13 options, calories and 12 types of workout exercises. To calculate a conversion, simply choose the activity you want to convert from the spinner, enter the amount of calories, minutes, or reps you would like to convert, then click the calculate button. A list will be generated with the conversion values for the 12 other items (not including the one you chose). To make a new conversion, just click on the input text field to enter a new amount or choose a different activity from the spinner. Then, click calculate again to update the list and see the new conversion values.
